                        <td>The "div" HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element). </td>
                        <td>It's used to group content so it can be easily styled using the class or id attributes, marking a section of a document as being written in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so on.</td>

                        <td>p</td>
                        <td>The "p" HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.</td>

                        <td>The <span> HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything.</td>
                        <td>It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate.</td>

                        <td>The "title" HTML element defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text; tags within the element are ignored.</td>

                        <td>The "header" HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.</td>
                        <td>The "header" element can define a global site header, described as a banner in the accessibility tree. It usually includes a logo, company name, search feature, and possibly the global navigation or a slogan.</td>

                    <tr>
                        <td>section</td>
                        <td>The "section" HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.</td>
                        <td>Is a generic sectioning element, and should only be used if there isn't a more specific element to represent it. As an example, a navigation menu should be wrapped in a <nav> element, but a list of search results or a map display and its controls don't have specific elements, and could be put inside a "section".</td>

                        <td>The "article" HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication).</td>
                        <td>The "article" element is a good choice to contain entire blog posts, news articles, and similar content.</td>
