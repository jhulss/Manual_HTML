                            The optional title attribute can provide an expansion for the abbreviation or acronym when a full expansion is not present.

                        <td>When an abbreviation is used and you want to provide an expansion or definition outside the flow of the document's content, use abbr> with an appropriate title.
                            To define an abbreviation which may be unfamiliar to the reader, present the term using abbr> and inline text providing the definition. Include a title attribute only when the inline expansion or definition is not available.
                            When an abbreviation's presence in the text needs to be semantically noted, the abbr> element is useful. This can be used, in turn, for styling or scripting purposes.
                            You can use abbr> in concert with dfn> to establish definitions for terms which are abbreviations or acronyms. See the example Defining an abbreviation below. </td>

                        <td>samp</td>
                        <td>The samp> HTML element is used to enclose inline text which represents sample (or quoted) output from a computer program. Its contents are typically rendered using the browser's default monospaced font (such as Courier or Lucida Console).</td>
                        <td>You can use a CSS rule to override the browser's default font face for the samp> element; however, it's possible that the browser's preferences may take precedence over any CSS you specify.</td>

                        <td>kbd</td>
                        <td>The "kbd" HTML element represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a kbd> element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.</td>
                        <td>Nesting a kbd> element within another kbd> element represents an actual key or other unit of input as a portion of a larger input. See Representing keystrokes within an input below.
                            Nesting a kbd> element inside a samp> element represents input that has been echoed back to the user by the system. See Echoed input, below, for an example.
                            Nesting a samp> element inside a kbd> element, on the other hand, represents input which is based on text presented by the system, such as the names of menus and menu items, or the names of buttons displayed on the screen. See the example under Representing onscreen input options below.</td>

                            This element should not contain more information than the contact information, like a publication date (which belongs in a time> element).
                            Typically an address> element can be placed inside the footer> element of the current section, if any.</td>
